<ul>
    <li>As This Project uses a pretrained ML model File This is needed to run the "bg-remove.py" </li>
    <li>You can Get that File <a href="https://mega.nz/file/wV5zECYb#C19BLp57nJ8b_7LVZDajWLDRf5HSml63n0skiK2bNuQ">HERE</a></li>
    <li>After Downloading it, just Put it in the same directory as "bg-remove.py"</li>
</ul>

Setup
============
* Download the [ Project files ](https://github.com/PuL5TaR/background-remover-py/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
* Extract the downloaded zip file
* go to the extracted directory
* Put the "u2net.onnx" File in that directory

<br>

How to use
============
After setup go to the base directory of remove-bg.py

run that python file through terminal in that directory
```
 python remove-bg.py
```
To input a specific image file 
* open remove-bg.py in any text-editor and
* Inside "main()" method give the relative or full path of Image to "input_path" Variable 
* The Images like ( .png, .jpg. jpeg .webp etc ) are all allowed

for example : `input_path = 'Images/myCustomImage.png'`

After running the "main.py" you will get the output Image in the same directory in "output.png"
